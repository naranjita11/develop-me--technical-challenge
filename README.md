**Instructions**: To view this app ....

**Brief**: The brief for this challenge was to *create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user*.

**Rationale**: I chose to use React and Redux to create this app. React allowed me to create many reuseable  components which are then displayed throughout the app. I utilised local state on parent components to keep track of temporary state changes such as form changes and then Redux allowed me to keep track of the winners throughout the tournament and return a success message to the overall winner.
